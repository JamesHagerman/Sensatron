# SENSATRON

This is the repo that will end up being the one-stop-shop for all code related to the Sensatron art car.

## Some notes

- Branches will be created for various years
- Master will be the current year

## Installing the dev platform

At some point, we will have some code to actually run... 


## Installing Processing to Unity launcher:

Add the following content to a new file located at: `/usr/share/applications/processing.desktop`

```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=2.1
Name=Processing
Comment=Processing Rocks
Exec=processing
Icon=/opt/processing/lib/icons/pde-256.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=AudioVideo;Video;Graphics;
```

And it should (after a few seconds) show up in the launcher.
