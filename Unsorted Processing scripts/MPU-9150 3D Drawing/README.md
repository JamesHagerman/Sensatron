MPU-9150 3D Drawing
===================

This project was put together to get data back from the MPU-9150 9DoF accelerometer via bluetooth and draw a 3D object in Processing that matches the movement of the 9DoF board.

It will take a bit of hacking to get it to NOT use the bluetooth module but it should still work okay either way.
