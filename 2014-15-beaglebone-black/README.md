# Where the heck is the code!?

In this case, the Beaglebone Black version of the Sensatron code is living in the `BBB-BM-Lights-2015` "git sub-module".

Basically, that means, you can find the code over here: [https://github.com/JamesHagerman/BBB-BM-Lights-2015](https://github.com/JamesHagerman/BBB-BM-Lights-2015)

# Releases

I actually tagged the versions we took to playa... so you can grab those git hashes from here: [https://github.com/JamesHagerman/BBB-BM-Lights-2015/releases](https://github.com/JamesHagerman/BBB-BM-Lights-2015/releases)
